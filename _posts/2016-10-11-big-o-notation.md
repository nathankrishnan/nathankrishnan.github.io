To describe how long an algorithm takes to run we use something called Big O Notation. Since hardware and software runtime environments  can vary widely, Big O Notation provides with a uniform method of comparing the efficiency.  For example, your iOS app will definitely run faster on an iPhone 7 Plus than an iPhone 5 because the iPhone 7 plus has better specs.  This does not provide a helpful benchmark because it's a given that performance will be better on a newer phone. In order to judge the performance of your algorithms we need to take a look how long they run:
1. Relative to size of the input
2. As the input becomes arbitrarily large

Every time you use this notation you literally write a capital O, parenthesis, and some algebraic expression in the parenthesis.  The algebraic expression is always going to be mathematical function of the variable *n*.  Where, *n* represents the length of an input into your function.

Let's take a look at some examples to make this concept seem less foreign.
