What comes to mind when you see the word stacks?  

Perhaps...

Or maybe this?

We're not going to talk about either in this post because when I say ***stacks*** I'm referring to the abstract data structure that is an ordered collection of items. 
In this collection, new items will be added to the top and removal of items will start from the top.  This ordering principle is known as LIFO, last-in first-out.


Think of it as a stack of books or a stack of dishes in your sink.


The most useful idea of a stack is that the order items are removed is exactly the reverse order that they were placed. i.e. removal is the reverse order of insertion. This is important because we can use stacks to reverse the order of things. For example, the Back button in a web browser (URLs going on a stack) or the back button in a music player (songs are going on a stack).
