My name is Nathan and I currently work at an investment firm as an interface layer between the US Intelligence Community and venture-backed startups.  Broadly speaking, I'm interested in mobile and web technologies.  Apple's [Swift programming language](https://swift.org/) caught my attention when it was publicly announced in June 2014. I like to explore the language and the iOS SDK in my free time.
