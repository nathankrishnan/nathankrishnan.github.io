My name is Nathan and I currently work at an investment firm as an interface layer between the US Intelligence Community and venture-backed startups.  Broadly speaking, I'm interested in mobile and web technologies.  My overarching goal in blogging is to take complex information and distill it to a form that's palatable but still precise.  

To my readers: I hope that my writing will help elucidate technical concepts and ideas.  Feel free to comment with any follow-up questions or thoughts for discussion.
